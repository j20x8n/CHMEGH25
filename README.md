1.          Consider the following fragment of a clinical guideline:Patients   with   stage   IIIB   or   IIIC   breast   cancer   should   be   treated   with   primary   chemotherapy.   Patients with stage IIIB or IIIC disease who respond to primary chemotherapy should be treated   until   the   response   plateaus   or   to   a   maximum   of   6 cycles   (minimum   4 cycles). Patients   with   stage   IIIB disease should then undergo definitive surgery and irradiation. The management of   patients   with   stage   IIIC   disease   who   respond   to   chemotherapy   should   be   individualized.   Patients with   stage IIIB or IIIC disease who achieve maximum   response with fewer than 6 cycles can   be given   further   adjuvant   chemotherapy   following   surgery   and   irradiation.   Patients   whose   tumours   do   not respond to primary chemotherapy can be treated with   taxane   chemotherapy   or   can   proceed   directly to irradiation followed by modified radical mastectomy, if   feasible.a)   Draw   an   entity   relationship   diagram   for the   information   that   would   have   to   be   represented   in   a   database   to   be   used   to   determine   which   treatment   was appropriate for each   patient.                    (14   marks)
b)   In   two   or   three   short   sentences,   summarise   some   of   the   challenges   in   representing the   logic   inherent   in this text   in a computable form.                    (6   marks)
Marks awarded for: 
2 something recognisably an ER diagram (not a flowchart, no if statements) 
6 plausible selection of entities and relationships 
2 cardinalities 
2 complete representation (e.g. includes properties relating to response to treatment and feasibility of surgery) 
2 clear layout 
ii) 
Detail goes beyond what is readily standardised in terminology, (2-3 marks) 
Some conditions that are relatively easy to express in language nevertheless have complex logic (2-3 marks) 
2.
a)   Draw   and   label   a dataflow diagram of the system   described   in   the   following   text.The Pan European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing   scheme   allows   a   user   to   install   an   app   on   their phone that will broadcast an encrypted ID. The app allows   another nearby phone   on   which   the   app is also installed to record this ID and the promixity   and duration   of   the   contact between   the   two   phones. If   a user of   the app tests positive for   Covid-19,   a healthcare   official   will provide   them   with   a   code   allowing the list of   IDs recorded   on their phone,   together   with   the   data   about   proximity   and   duration, to be   downloaded to   a   server. The   server runs   an   algorithm   to   determine   the   level   of   risk   associated with each contact and,   if   appropriate, adds the ID to a list.   The   app   constantly   checks this   list and if   it recognises the ID, the user will be notified   and given   suitable   advice.                           (16   marks)b) The   authors   of a   study   of this   kind   of system wrote   that:   “the   accuracy with   which   Bluetooth   low   energy   signatures   can   be   converted   to   useful   proxies   of   transmission   risk   is   currently   uncertain”   .   Explain   what   is   meant   by   the   term ‘useful    proxies’ in this sentence and comment on the significance of this   statement.           (4   marks)
Marks awarded for: 
2 something recognisably an dataflow diagram (not a flowchart, no if statements) 
6 plausible model of the system with all key features included 
2 comprehensive model of the system with all above features included 
4 correct representation (e.g. no dead ends, no datastores doing processing) 
2 clear layout 
ii) A    useful proxy here    is    something    that can    be    easily measured    (the strength and duration of a phone’s contact with a signal from another phone) and which can serve instead of something important but less easily measured (the risk of disease transmission between two individuals in close proximity). ( Two marks) 
The value of these apps is dependent on the extent to which the proxy measurement matches the risk we care about. ( Two marks) 3)    In    no      more    than      eight      short      paragraphs      set      out      a      proposal    for      an   evaluation   of the   effectiveness   of video   consultations   in   primary   care. You   should:
•          briefly explain   how these consultations are   booked and conducted
•         outline   key   research question that needs to be   answered
•         describe   and   justify   the   study   design
•          provide the   key metrics to   be   measured                                                (20   marks)
Accurate account of the consultation (2 marks) 
Good research questions (2 marks)

代做程序编程语言other healthcare resourses), Acceptability for patients
Valid research study design (4 marks) Good justification (4 marks) 
Provide the key criteria on how each research question will be evaluated (4 marks) 
Good statement of limitations (4 marks) 4) A clinical team is working with a tech start-up company to   develop   a   new   software tool to help in the management of sepsis. The company would   like   to    access    a    wide    range    of    data      items    about      patients    who      have      been   diagnosed   with sepsis, and an appropriate control group, in order to develop   machine learning algorithms.
a)    Does   the   GDPR   allow   the   clinical   team   to   anonymise   the   data   in   order   to supply it to the tech company? Explain your answer in one or   two short paragraphs.   (4   marks) 
b)    The    clinical    team    propose    to      supply      the      clinicians    with      software    to   perform   the   anonymisation   on   the   data   before   it   leaves   the   hospital.   Who,    in    this    example,    is    the    Data      Processor      and    who      is    the      Data
Controller?   Explain your answer in one or two short   paragraphs.   (4   marks)
c)      Does   UK   law   allow   the   company   to   use   the   anonymised   data   without   having the consent of the patients whose treatments are recorded in the data?   Explain your answer in one or two short   paragraphs.   (4   marks) 
d)    The   clinical   team   want   to   apply   for   appropriate   ethics   for   the   research   they are doing with company.   Is ethical approval required? What form. of ethical approval might they   obtain?   (4   marks) 
e)      If the work did not involve transferring data to a   tech   start   up   but   instead   was   done   by the   company who   currently   provide the   hospital   with   EHR   services,   and   therefore   routinely   have   access   to   the   data,   would   they   require   permission   to   use   personal   data   to   develop   machine   learning algorithms?   (4   marks) 
a) Expected answer is ‘yes’ or but ‘no’ is acceptable ifjustified. Key point can is whether the access is compatible with the purpose for which the data is stored. Explicit consent not required 
b) Clinicians/the hospital are the data controllers and processors. Credit will be given for different answers that are well reasoned.
c) Yes, if the data is anonymised there is no data protection issue, no confidentiality issue, GDPR doesn’tapply. 
d)    If the    data is anonymised, then no ethics is required but they can apply for HRA ethics to cover the use of anonymised data. 
e) If this    is the development of a new product, might be considered research, which would require consent. Beyond the scope of what patients would reasonably expect the data to be used for. 
5)
a)    Explain       the       terms         ‘Sustainability         and         Transformation          Plan’       and   ‘   Integrated      Care      System   ’.      Use      two      or      three      sentences      for      each explanation.   (4      marks) 
b)      Explain,   in   one   or   two   short   paragraphs,   how   thinking   in   terms   of   an   ‘Integrated Care System’ might make   it easier to   improve   digital   support for healthcare.   (4      marks) 
c)      Describe,   in one or two short paragraphs the main   challenges   to   be   met
in delivering a digital strategy for an   Integrated   Care   System.   (4      marks)
d)    Explain, in three or   four   short paragraphs, an approach to evaluating how   much   progress an organisation   has   made towards   making effective   use   of digital technology.   List some of the   strengths and   weaknesses   of   the approach.   (8      marks) 
a) ’Sustainability and Transformation Plan’ : NHS/UK government initiative regionally based, encouraging increased collaboration including social care. 
‘Integrated Care System’ : approach to delivering health and social care for a region which emphasises collaboration between organisations 
1 marks for broadly correct definition, 2 for a comprehensive or insightful answer 
b) A range of possible answers including: 
Collaboration on digital health projects across partners Purchasing shared solutions 
Wider focus    enables more strategic    thinking    about investments (not limited to projects that benefit a single organisation) 
c) A range of possible answers but key points are: Small budget 
Limited power over the actions of component organisations Legacy systems 
d) Digital maturity assessment (1 mark), structured questionnaire with themes (2 marks), self-assessment (1 mark) 
Weakness: self-reported, subjective, open to gaming, not dynamic 
Strengths: structured, transparent (up to a point), ensure a degree of consistency, reported by staff with knowledge of the trust 
(other suggestions are possible, 1 marks for a valid point, 2 for insightful, total of 4 marks available)
